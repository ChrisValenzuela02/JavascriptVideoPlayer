Now that we've looked at the architecture
of the internet, let's see how you might

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.535 line:12
connect your personal devices to
the internet inside your house.

3
00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:11.270 line:12
Well there are many ways to
connect to the internet, and

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.960 line:12
most often people connect wirelessly.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.940 line:12
Let's look at an example of how
you can connect to the internet.

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.370 line:12
If you live in a city or a town,
you probably have a coaxial cable for

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.880 line:12
cable Internet, or a phone line if you
have DSL, running to the outside of

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.920 line:12
your house, that connects you to
the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.730 line:12
If you live far out in the country,
you'll more likely have

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.430 line:12
a dish outside your house, connecting
you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or

11
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.190 line:12
you might also use the telephone system.

12
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.300 line:12
Whether a wire comes straight from
the ISP hookup outside your house, or

13
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.270 line:12
it travels over radio
waves from your roof,

14
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.760 line:12
the first stop a wire will make once
inside your house, is at your modem.

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.780 line:12
A modem is what connects the internet
to your network at home.

16
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.150 line:12
