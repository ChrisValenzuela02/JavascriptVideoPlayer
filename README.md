# JavascriptVideoPlayer
This project takes a video file and replaces the default HTML5 controls with custom controls created using Javascript. It also includes a transcript below the video that syncs with the audio and highlights the text as the video plays.

Still looking to improve this project with clickable transcript and speed controls. (Hopefully soon!)
